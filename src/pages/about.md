## Hey there 👋

I'm Ryan Duffy, a nerd at heart who loves working with new tech and exploring what can be achieved when humans and AI collaborate.

By day, I work at BT. By night (and weekends), I build AI infrastructure, experiment with local LLMs, and document the journey.

## The ConvoCanvas Story

This blog started with a simple problem: context window overflow. September 11, 2025, I hit the limit in a conversation with Claude Code and realized I was drowning in 200+ scattered AI conversations with no way to extract value.

25 days later: A self-documenting system with ChromaDB semantic search, 17 local models, K3s infrastructure, and automated architecture diagrams. All built collaboratively with Claude Code.

**Season 1** documents that journey - 8 episodes, 15,550 words, complete with the crashes, the learning, and the honest reality of building in 2025 when AI capabilities evolve weekly.

## What I'm About

**Building with AI, not replacing humans with AI.** Claude provides patterns, I provide context and judgment. Together we solve problems neither could handle alone.

**Learning in public.** The failures, the overkill decisions (looking at you, K3s), the 6,812 pod restarts - it's all documented.

**Honest iteration over grand promises.** The system works. It's not "done." We iterate based on what makes sense.

## Tech I Use

- **AI**: Claude Code, Ollama (17 local models), ChromaDB for semantic search
- **Infrastructure**: K3s, Docker, Prefect for automation
- **Code**: Python, FastAPI, TypeScript
- **Tools**: Obsidian vault (1,142+ files), MCP for AI memory, Astro for this blog

## What's Next?

Season 2? Maybe. If AI capabilities evolve in interesting ways. If there's something worth building.

The only certainty: Human + AI collaboration will keep evolving. And I'll keep documenting it honestly.
